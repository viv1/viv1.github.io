Hi, I am a ***BE(Hons) Computer Science Engineering graduate from BITS Pilani***, Pilani Campus, with over ***8 years*** of diverse software development experience across ***both MNCs and product-based startups*** (cloud infrastructure, HR SAAS, e-commerce webapp, gaming). I am currently working for ***Oracle Gen2 cloud*** as part of their *API gateway team* where we are providing a secure, scalable and feature rich reverse proxy service. I have heavy ***experience with interviewing candidates*** and have also been part of several ***campus placement initiatives*** in my current and previous company.

In my free time, I love ***dabbling with new technologies or concepts*** to learn or ***build developer productivity tools*** or to build fun games or try ***building the next big thing***. I occasionally ***provide freelance assistance***, from building websites & webapps to implementing complete backend and infrastructure from scratch. 
I also mentor and interview potential candidates for software roles.

I am ***currently involved*** in a couple of side projects with possible business opportunities. One is a SAAS product that would add additional support to the business owner websites. Another is a GenAI based platform in the Edtech domain for enhancing certain skill set of school/college students.

My ***non-coding interests*** are Cricket, Tennis and Card games, and I am always available for a bit of outdoor activities around the city.

To connect with me, hit me up on my email: `hello@wewake.dev`.
